## Kapitel 2 - Theory der Wirtschaft

<!-- {"id": "02_000_0259_4131"} -->

Like other sciences and fields of study, economics is a body of theory. Theory is a collection of explanations that allows us to understand something. Economic theory allows us to *understand how an economy works*. It explains the workings of the economy as a whole so that we can understand the meaning, impact, origins, and evolution of economic phenomena.

For a theory to be reliable and useful, it must provide a coherent picture. If it doesn’t, then some of its explanations are contradictory. Contradictions are a sign that something is wrong. So, the body of a theory must be logically stringent and must make up a consistent whole. This means it must be consistent with the basic assumptions on which it rests—it must be true to first principles.

<!-- {"id": "02_002_89e6_804f"} -->

But it is not enough to produce a consistent whole based on first principles if those principles are themselves flawed. We could produce an internally consistent theory based on faulty assumptions. Such systems can be very convincing because they are consistent, but they cannot to provide real understanding as each of its explanations hinges on something that is not true and is perhaps not even reasonable. You would not want to cross a bridge designed by an engineer who believes paper is stronger than iron. It doesn’t matter how accurate his math is or how sophisticated his design—the assumption is wrong and therefore the bridge is not reliable. It cannot hold the expected weight even if every calculation is accurate. The same is true of economic theory: it must be built on solid principles and reliable assumptions.

So, for a theory to properly explain how the world works, it must be internally consistent *and* be based on true assumptions. A theory cannot provide us with real understanding of the world if it only meets one of those criteria; it must meet both.

### Die Grundannahmen

Economics is based in the concept of human action as purposeful behavior. What this means is that when people act, they try to achieve something. It does not mean that they are always accurate or do the “right thing” (whatever that is). Instead, it means that they try to achieve something because they *value* the expected outcome in some way. What they value, why they value it, and whether or not their valuations are reasonable and rational is irrelevant. Such questions are outside the scope of economic theory. What matters is that their action is motivated by the expected outcome.

<!-- {"id": "02_005_67af_4c18"} -->

It may appear strange that economics does not deal with the reasons people value some things but not others. However, the dreams, fantasies, and imaginations of people are only relevant to economics if they are *acted upon*. After all, if you have a dream that you do not act on, you are not making it happen. It remains but a dream. The dream itself makes no difference in the world; to merely wish does not make it real.

So, action is a rather logical starting point to study social reality. Acting is how we make changes to the world.

### Entschlüsselung des Menschlichen Handelns

<!-- {"id": "02_007_e479_58a1"} -->

It's surprisingly powerful, to recognize action for what it is: purposeful behavior. It provides us with insights about human affairs far beyond what most people think possible. In fact, the economist Ludwig von Mises showed that economic theory can be derived from this simple concept.

<!-- {"id": "02_008_2e69_3195"} -->

Lets look at what we can learn about the world simply from elaborating on the meaning of human action. We have already pointed out that people act to achive some purpose that makes sense to the actor. We know that actions are directed toward attaining some outcome that the actor considers beneficial. In other words, actions are intended to achieve something the actor personally values.

<!-- {"id": "02_009_19e1_bf5b"} -->

Because actors try to achieve something, it follows that they have not already attained it and they take actions to become better off than they already are. So we can conclude that there are things actors want because they  believe these things would make them better off. They do not have these things, but they think they can attain them by taking an action. In other words, actions are fundamentally *causal*: we act because we believe that we can bring about a specific change.

<!-- {"id": "02_010_8894_581f"} -->

We also conclude that actors believe their action is the best or only way to attain the outcome. Why else would they undertake the action? If they have not already acted, they were either were unaware of the means to attain the outcome, or they lacked the means to act, or they had other ends which the ranked higher. All of these imply scarcity and that the actor makes choices. The actor has insufficient means to satisfy all his wants and must go without some in order to attain others. That the actor must choose implies that he or she must make tradeoffs. In other words, the actor *economizes*.

<!-- {"id": "02_011_2be8_fee9"} -->

We can also conclude that human action is in fact always *individual* action motivated by some personally valued end and taken toward that end. Other individuals may have the same outcome in mind, and to be feasible an action might require collaboration, but this does not change the fact that each person acts. People may choose to act in concert, but those are individual choices. The group itself does not act. That four people collaborate to lift and move a piano does not mean that the group lifted the piano but that the four people coordinated their individual efforts toward that common end. In other words, economics is *methodologically individualist*.

<!-- {"id": "02_012_1186_3e9d"} -->

Things like business firms, groups, and governments exist and have a real effect on how people act. But we cannot understand these effects without also recognizing that the people *in* firms, groups, and governments act. By recognizing this, we understand that actors within groups may have goals that contradict the stated goals of the group and therefore are in tension with them. Some people may act in ways that undermine the stated goals of the group. This would not be possible had we assumed that the group itself acts.

### Die Genialität des Handlungsaxioms

<!-- {"id": "02_013_4320_b0d1"} -->

Economics uses logical reasoning to uncover the processes that make up the economy and it recognizes that the motivation for action is personal—that *value is subjective*. Value subjectivity allows economists to formulate a realistic and reliable theory that explains prices as a result of personal valuations.

<!-- {"id": "02_014_20c0_af5d"} -->

As each action is a choice between specific alternatives, the individual ranks their options. The decisions of an actor always concern concrete goods, such as a particular product or service, not goods in the abstract. He decides about the value of a specific loaf of bread for him, not about the value of bread as such. When individuals choose between options, they implicitly rank these options by their very actions. This is so, because every choice for one option, is always a choice against lower-ranked options. This process of rank ordering alternatives is "economizing" in nature. Each ranking is based on the anticipated subjective value the actors expect the outcome of the action will provide to them.

We never value things in themselves, but for the satisfaction we think they can provide us. A glass of water in the desert is probably more satisfying than a glass of water while loafing on the couch at home. Why? Because we value things by the satisfaction they can give us in the situation we are in. When loafing on the couch, the greatest satisfaction we can get from a glass of water is not nearly as high as when trying to stay hydrated and alive in a desert. And the more we have of something, the lesser the satisfaction of using another one. In fact, each unit of something is valued at the satisfaction we can get out of the last (marginal) unit.

<!-- {"id": "02_016_8a81_d770"} -->

So in any situation, if we have three glasses of water, we value each of them less than if we had only two. But more than if we had had four. Because the value to us of any one glass is the satisfaction it contributes. Since we always satisfy our least urgent wants last, the marginal unit contributes the lowest marginal value. That’s why we act differently depending on the quantity we have of something and how important the satisfactions are that we expect to get from them. Put differently, we value each glass according to the satisfaction it would cost us, were we to lose it. We call this the opportunity cost.

In other words, action connects our subjective valuations to reality. Action brings the rankings of choices from our heads into the outside world. It changes the world according to what actions we conceive of, the outcomes we anticipate, and which of these we prefer. Action bridges our individual subjective valuations to results in the real world. The fact that we cannot measure subjective valuations is not critical to our understanding of the economy, as such valuations are not the starting point for economic reasoning. We need not know what people value or why they do so, it is enough to know that they do so and that this is the foundation of human action.

All economic phenomena are the result of human actions. Every resource allocation, every market price and even business cycles emerge from human action, which by nature is purposeful and economizing. The task of economics is therefore to understand the economy and everything it entails from the perspective of the ultimate cause: human action.
